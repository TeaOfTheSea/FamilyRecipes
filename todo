Update brown-betty.md to restructure the instructions in a layered order

Nana questions for mom recipes:
  Where does the bracketed text apply in chicken-divan.md
  Is pie-crust.md a suitable crust for the recipes buttermilk-pie.md, blackberry-pie-filling.md and chocolate-pie.md
  In ribbon-salad.md, what is the meaning of "min" and the word that I can't read.
  In biscuits-for-gravy.md, get the oven temperature
