## About:

This site is a fork of [based.cooking](https://based.cooking/) that I made because the original site prohibits sweets. Instead of just being a baking recipe site however, I've decided to go the direction of trying to archive a few family cookbooks in their entirety to preserve my family's culinary tradition somewhat.

## Open source and accepting contributions, but not for recipes.

In the spirit of the website whose code I am using, the entirety of this site can be found [on Github](https://github.com/TeaOfTheSea/FamilyRecipes).
That said, this is a personal project to preserve the recipes of my family, so I won't be accepting recipe submissions. If you do want to contribute for some reason, however, feel free to submit a picture of anything you bake, or fill in any of the missing information related to prep times and serving sizes.
