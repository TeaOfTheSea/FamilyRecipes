## About:

This site is a fork of [based.cooking](based.cooking) that I made because the original site prohibits sweets. Instead of just being a baking recipe site however, I've decided to go the direction of trying to archive a few family cookbooks in their entirety to preserve my family's culinary tradition somewhat.

## Open source, but no contributions please!

In the spirit of the website whose code I am using, the entirety of this site can be found [on Github](https://github.com/TeaOfTheSea/FamilyRecipes).
That said, this is a personal project and I don't plan on adding any recipes that I do not personally curate.
